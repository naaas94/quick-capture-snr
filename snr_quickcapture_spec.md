# SNR QUICKCAPTURE — ENHANCED SYSTEM BREAKDOWN FOR PRODUCTION

## CORE SEMANTIC VECTOR
A production-grade symbolic ingestion layer for structured thought logging, with intelligent capture, semantic validation, hybrid storage, comprehensive observability, and downstream semantic alignment.

## SYSTEM PURPOSE
QuickCapture (QC) is not a note-taking application. It is an epistemically constrained, intelligent ingestion interface designed to:
- Capture symbolic thoughts using a minimal controlled grammar with semantic assistance.
- Validate both structural and semantic coherence with quality scoring.
- Store entries in hybrid SQLite/vector store with atomic operations and semantic search.
- Provide intelligent tag management with suggestion, drift detection, and quality scoring.
- Monitor system health and performance with comprehensive observability.
- Serve as a high-integrity, intelligent input layer for downstream semantic infrastructure such as the Semantic Note Router (SNR).

## ENHANCED PIPELINE — TECHNICAL STEPS

### Step 0. CLI Entry with Intelligence
- File: `scripts/quick_add.py`
- Input: Raw string of the format `"tag1, tag2: note body : optional comment"`
- Enhanced with real-time tag suggestions and semantic assistance
- Triggered via CLI or GUI wrapper (e.g., Electron/Tauri hotkey launcher)

### Step 1. Enhanced Input Parsing
- File: `scripts/parse_input.py`
- Extracts with semantic preprocessing:
  - `tags: List[str]`
  - `note: str`
  - `comment: Optional[str]`
  - `semantic_density: float`
  - `content_type: ContentType`
  - `confidence_score: float`
- Outputs: Enhanced `ParsedNote` object with comprehensive metadata

### Step 2. Multi-Dimensional Validation
- File: `scripts/validate_note.py`
- Enhanced validation criteria:
  - Structural validation (tags, body presence)
  - Semantic validation (coherence scoring, content quality)
  - Tag quality validation (relevance, hierarchy alignment)
  - Content type classification and validation
- Output: `{ "valid": true/false, "issues": [..], "semantic_coherence_score": float, "tag_quality_score": float, "overall_confidence": float }`

### Step 3. Intelligent Storage (Hybrid Architecture)
- Primary: SQLite with proper indexing and atomic operations
- Secondary: Vector store for semantic search and similarity
- Tertiary: JSONL backup for replay and migration
- Each parsed note stored with comprehensive metadata and quality scores
- Notes are never discarded; invalid entries are flagged with quality metrics

### Step 4. Enhanced Outlier Review with Intelligence
- File: `scripts/review_outliers.py`
- CLI interface with semantic assistance
- Intelligent suggestions for improvements
- Auto-correction capabilities with manual override
- Tracks corrections via `version` field with learning patterns

## ENHANCED DOWNSTREAM ALIGNMENT WITH SEMANTIC NOTE ROUTER (SNR)

### Advanced Text Preprocessing for Embeddings
- Semantic density calculation and optimization
- Content-specific preprocessing based on content type
- Quality-aware text optimization for downstream vectorization
- Preserve semantic structure while stripping syntactic clutter
- Intelligent character normalization and punctuation handling

### Intelligent Tag-System Alignment
- File: `config/tag_intelligence.yaml`
- Tag suggestion system with semantic similarity
- Tag hierarchy management and drift detection
- Quality scoring for tag relevance and consistency
- Co-occurrence pattern analysis for tag optimization

### Comprehensive Metadata Enrichment for SNR
- Enhanced `ParsedNote` with:
  - `semantic_density` and `semantic_coherence_score`
  - `tag_quality_score` and `tag_hierarchy`
  - `content_type` and `confidence_score`
  - `co_occurrence_patterns` and `embedding_vector`
  - `optimized_body` and `snr_metadata`

### Intelligent Batch Processing Pipeline
- Function: `process_batch_for_snr()`
- Quality-aware batch processing with performance optimization
- Semantic density scoring and filtering
- Tag hierarchy alignment and optimization
- Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
- Error handling with fallback strategies

### Enhanced Error Handling and Fallbacks
- Semantic quality scoring for all notes
- Confidence-based processing decisions
- Fallback strategies for low-quality content
- SNR compatibility flags with quality metrics
- Raw body preservation for downstream embedding
