# Progress Report

## Current Status

- **Storage Engine**: Implemented with SQLite for structured data and Faiss for semantic search.
  - SQLite is set up for storing notes with various metadata.
  - Faiss index is initialized for vector-based semantic search.

- **Embedding Generation**: Not yet implemented. Necessary for populating the Faiss index with meaningful data.

- **Background Script**: Conceptualized for running a script that listens for key combinations to trigger note-taking.
  - Example script provided for listening to `Alt + Space` and capturing notes.

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Integrate a model (e.g., Sentence Transformers) to generate embeddings for notes.
   - Store these embeddings in the Faiss index for semantic search.

2. **Background Service**:
   - Finalize the script to run as a background service.
   - Ensure it starts on system boot and listens for key combinations.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a simple GUI for note entry and querying.
   - Ensure seamless integration with the storage engine.

4. **Installer Creation**:
   - Use a tool like Inno Setup to create an installer.
   - Include steps for setting up the vector store and configuring the application.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of the entire system.
   - Validate the accuracy and performance of the embedding and search functionalities.

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Synchronization**: Implement a feature to sync local data with a cloud-based data lake like BigQuery.
- **Advanced Querying**: Enhance the querying capabilities to support more complex searches and recommendations.
