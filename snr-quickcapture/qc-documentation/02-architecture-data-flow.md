# Architecture and Data Flow

## System Architecture Overview

QuickCapture follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns and modular design principles. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Purpose**: Manages user interface and input handling.
- **Components**: Includes CLI interfaces, API endpoints, and web interfaces.
- **Responsibilities**: Handles input validation, user interaction, and response formatting.

### 2. Application Layer
- **Purpose**: Contains business logic and orchestration.
- **Components**: Comprises core processing modules and workflow engines.
- **Responsibilities**: Manages request routing, business rule enforcement, and data transformation.

### 3. Domain Layer
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates core business logic and domain models.
- **Components**: Consists of data models, validation rules, and business entities.
- **Responsibilities**: Ensures domain logic, data integrity, and business rules are maintained.

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Purpose**: Addresses technical concerns and external integrations.
- **Components**: Includes storage engines, external APIs, and monitoring systems.
- **Responsibilities**: Manages data persistence, external service integration, and system monitoring.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Input Processing Flow

The system processes user input through a series of stages:

1. **Input Reception**: Content is received through various interfaces.
2. **Validation**: Content is validated against predefined rules and constraints.
3. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for further processing.
4. **Embedding**: Content is transformed into semantic vector representations.
5. **Classification**: Content is categorized and tagged based on semantic analysis.
6. **Storage**: Processed content is stored in appropriate storage systems.

### Processing Pipeline

- **Phase 1: Ingestion**
  - Validates and sanitizes content.
  - Extracts and enriches metadata.
  - Assesses and scores content quality.

- **Phase 2: Semantic Processing**
  - Generates text embeddings.
  - Analyzes and understands context.
  - Calculates semantic similarity.

- **Phase 3: Classification**
  - Categorizes content.
  - Assigns and validates tags.
  - Makes routing decisions.

- **Phase 4: Storage**
  - Implements a multi-layer storage strategy.
  - Optimizes indexing.
  - Ensures backup and redundancy.

## Component Interactions

### Core Module Dependencies

The following modules interact to process and store data:

- **`quick_add.py`**: Main entry point for adding new data.
  - **`parse_input.py`**: Handles raw input parsing.
  - **`validate_note.py`**: Ensures data quality through validation.
  - **`snr_preprocess.py`**: Prepares content for analysis.
  - **`tag_intelligence.py`**: Performs semantic analysis and classification.
  - **`storage_engine.py`**: Manages data persistence and storage.

#### Data Flow Between Components

1. **Input Processing**
   - `parse_input.py` parses raw input.
   - `validate_note.py` validates data quality.
   - `snr_preprocess.py` prepares content for analysis.

2. **Intelligence Layer**
   - `tag_intelligence.py` conducts semantic analysis.
   - Classification models determine content categories.
   - Routing logic directs content to appropriate storage.

3. **Storage Layer**
   - `storage_engine.py` manages data persistence.
   - Vector stores handle semantic similarity.
   - File systems store raw content and metadata.

## Configuration Architecture

#### Configuration Hierarchy

Configuration files are organized as follows:

- **`config/`**
  - `grammar_rules.yaml`: Contains validation rules.
  - `semantic_validation.yaml`: Defines semantic rules.
  - `storage_config.yaml`: Specifies storage settings.
  - `tag_intelligence.yaml`: Configures classification settings.
  - `observability.yaml`: Sets monitoring configurations.

#### Configuration Flow

1. **System Startup**: Configuration files are loaded and validated.
2. **Runtime Updates**: Configuration changes are applied dynamically.
3. **Validation**: Configuration integrity is maintained throughout execution.

## Observability Architecture

#### Monitoring Stack

The observability stack includes:

- **`observability/`**
  - `health_monitor.py`: Monitors system health.
  - `metrics_collector.py`: Collects performance metrics.
  - `performance_tracker.py`: Analyzes performance.
  - `drift_detector.py`: Detects model drift.

#### Observability Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Metrics and logs are collected from all components.
2. **Processing**: Data is aggregated and analyzed.
3. **Alerting**: Thresholds trigger notifications and alerts.
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards provide system insights.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Utilizes stateless processing components, load balancing, and distributed storage systems.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Focuses on resource optimization, efficient algorithms, and performance monitoring.
- **Data Partitioning**: Employs content-based, time-based, and geographic distribution strategies.

## Security Architecture

- **Data Protection**: Implements encryption, access control, and audit logging.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures comprehensive sanitization and protection against SQL injection and XSS.

## Integration Patterns

- **External Service Integration**: Utilizes API-based communication, event-driven architectures, and message queue systems.
- **Data Exchange Formats**: Uses JSON for API communications, YAML for configuration, and binary formats for efficient storage.
