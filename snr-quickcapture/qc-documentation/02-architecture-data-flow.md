# Architecture and Data Flow

## System Architecture Overview

QuickCapture follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns and modular design principles. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Purpose**: User interface and input handling
- **Components**: CLI interfaces, API endpoints, web interfaces
- **Responsibilities**: Input validation, user interaction, response formatting

### 2. Application Layer
- **Purpose**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Components**: Core processing modules, workflow engines
- **Responsibilities**: Request routing, business rule enforcement, data transformation

### 3. Domain Layer
- **Purpose**: Core business logic and domain models
- **Components**: Data models, validation rules, business entities
- **Responsibilities**: Domain logic, data integrity, business rules

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Purpose**: Technical concerns and external integrations
- **Components**: Storage engines, external APIs, monitoring systems
- **Responsibilities**: Data persistence, external service integration, system monitoring

## Data Flow Architecture

### Input Processing Flow

```
User Input → Validation → Preprocessing → Embedding → Classification → Storage
```

1. **Input Reception**: System receives content through various interfaces
2. **Validation**: Content is validated against defined rules and constraints
3. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for processing
4. **Embedding**: Content is converted to semantic vector representations
5. **Classification**: Content is categorized and tagged based on semantic analysis
6. **Storage**: Processed content is stored in appropriate storage systems

### Processing Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Ingestion
- Content validation and sanitization
- Metadata extraction and enrichment
- Quality assessment and scoring

#### Phase 2: Semantic Processing
- Text embedding generation
- Context analysis and understanding
- Semantic similarity calculations

#### Phase 3: Classification
- Content categorization
- Tag assignment and validation
- Routing decision making

#### Phase 4: Storage
- Multi-layer storage strategy
- Indexing and optimization
- Backup and redundancy

## Component Interactions

### Core Module Dependencies

```
quick_add.py
├── parse_input.py (input processing)
├── validate_note.py (validation)
├── snr_preprocess.py (preprocessing)
├── tag_intelligence.py (classification)
└── storage_engine.py (storage)
```

### Data Flow Between Components

1. **Input Processing**
   - `parse_input.py` handles raw input parsing
   - `validate_note.py` ensures data quality
   - `snr_preprocess.py` prepares content for analysis

2. **Intelligence Layer**
   - `tag_intelligence.py` performs semantic analysis
   - Classification models determine content categories
   - Routing logic directs content to appropriate storage

3. **Storage Layer**
   - `storage_engine.py` manages data persistence
   - Vector stores handle semantic similarity
   - File systems store raw content and metadata

## Configuration Architecture

### Configuration Hierarchy

```
config/
├── grammar_rules.yaml (validation rules)
├── semantic_validation.yaml (semantic rules)
├── storage_config.yaml (storage settings)
├── tag_intelligence.yaml (classification config)
└── observability.yaml (monitoring config)
```

### Configuration Flow

1. **System Startup**: Configuration files are loaded and validated
2. **Runtime Updates**: Configuration changes are applied dynamically
3. **Validation**: Configuration integrity is maintained throughout execution

## Observability Architecture

### Monitoring Stack

```
observability/
├── health_monitor.py (system health)
├── metrics_collector.py (performance metrics)
├── performance_tracker.py (performance analysis)
└── drift_detector.py (model drift detection)
```

### Observability Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Metrics and logs are collected from all components
2. **Processing**: Data is aggregated and analyzed
3. **Alerting**: Thresholds trigger notifications and alerts
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards provide system insights

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless processing components
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Distributed storage systems

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource optimization and caching
- Efficient algorithms and data structures
- Performance monitoring and tuning

### Data Partitioning
- Content-based partitioning strategies
- Time-based data organization
- Geographic distribution for global access

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and authentication
- Audit logging and compliance

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection measures

## Integration Patterns

### External Service Integration
- API-based communication
- Event-driven architectures
- Message queue systems

### Data Exchange Formats
- JSON for API communications
- YAML for configuration
- Binary formats for efficient storage
