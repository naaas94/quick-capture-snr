# Observability

## Overview

Observability in QuickCapture provides deep visibility into system health, performance, and behavior. This document describes the observability stack, metrics, logging, and alerting strategies.

## Observability Components

### 1. Metrics Collection
- **metrics_collector.py**: Collects and aggregates system and application metrics. It supports Prometheus integration for metrics collection and provides local storage for metrics if Prometheus is unavailable. The `MetricsCollector` class manages metrics such as ingestion rate, validation success rate, semantic coherence, and more. It also supports background collection and updates metrics every 15 seconds.

#### Example Metrics
- `note_processing_time_seconds`
- `embedding_generation_time_seconds`
- `classification_accuracy`
- `storage_write_latency_seconds`
- `system_cpu_usage_percent`
- `system_memory_usage_percent`

### 2. Logging
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs for all major events and errors
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation and archival
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Remove PII from logs

#### Example Log Entry
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "embedding_layer",
  "event": "embedding_generated",
  "note_id": "abc123",
  "duration": 0.85
}
```

### 3. Health Monitoring
- **health_monitor.py**: Monitors system health and component status. The `HealthMonitor` class performs comprehensive health checks, including database connectivity, storage performance, validation performance, and more. It uses a set of thresholds to determine the health status and can trigger alerts if certain conditions are met. The class supports background monitoring and maintains a history of health checks.

#### Example Health Check
```python
from observability.health_monitor import HealthMonitor
monitor = HealthMonitor()
status = monitor.get_system_health()
print(status)
```

### 4. Alerting
- **Threshold-based Alerts**: Error rate, processing time, resource usage
- **Notification Channels**: Email, Slack, dashboards
- **Alert Rules**: Configurable in `observability.yaml`

#### Example Alert Rule
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "high_error_rate"
    condition: "error_rate > 0.05"
    severity: "warning"
    notification_channels:
      - type: "email"
        recipients: ["admin@example.com"]
```

## Observability Best Practices
- Monitor all critical system components
- Use structured, searchable logs
- Set actionable alert thresholds
- Regularly review metrics and logs
- Test health checks and alerting
- Document all observability configurations

## Configuration

The `observability.yaml` file defines settings for metrics collection, health monitoring, performance tracking, and alerting. It includes settings for Prometheus, custom metrics, health check thresholds, and alert channels. The file also configures logging, dashboard components, and export formats.
