# Testing Framework

## Overview

QuickCapture includes a robust testing framework to ensure system reliability, correctness, and maintainability. This document describes the testing strategy, test types, and best practices for testing the system and its extensions.

## Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and to facilitate refactoring.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated test runs on every commit to catch issues early and maintain code quality.
- **Coverage Goals**: Aim for >90% code coverage on core modules to ensure comprehensive testing and minimize the risk of undetected bugs.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation to verify their correctness.
- **Design**: Use mocks for external dependencies to ensure tests are fast and isolated.
- **Execution**: Fast execution with high isolation, allowing for quick feedback during development.

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between components, such as the ingestion and embedding layers, to ensure they work together as expected.
- **Design**: Use real or test databases and storage to validate data flow and error handling.
- **Execution**: Validate the integration of multiple components and their interactions.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Purpose**: Simulate real user workflows to validate the system's behavior under realistic scenarios.
- **Design**: Test the full pipeline from input to storage, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.
- **Execution**: Validate system behavior and user experience.

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Purpose**: Benchmark processing speed, throughput, and resource usage to identify bottlenecks and regressions.
- **Design**: Conduct stress and load testing to evaluate system performance under various conditions.
- **Execution**: Identify performance issues and optimize system efficiency.

### 5. Regression Tests
- **Purpose**: Ensure new changes do not break existing features, maintaining system stability.
- **Design**: Run on every release and major change to catch regressions early.
- **Execution**: Validate that existing functionality remains intact after updates.

## Test Organization

- **Directory Structure**: All tests are located in the `snr-quickcapture/tests/` directory, organized by functionality.
- **Naming Convention**: Test files are named `test_*.py` to clearly indicate their purpose.
- **Test Runner**: Use `pytest` as the main test runner for its simplicity and powerful features.

## Example Test Structure
```
tests/
├── test_basic_functionality.py
├── test_failed_notes.py
├── test_observability.py
```

## Example Unit Test
```python
def test_note_validation():
    from scripts.validate_note import validate_note
    note = {"content": "Test note", "note_id": "123"}
    result = validate_note(note)
    assert result.is_valid
```

## Example Integration Test
```python
def test_full_pipeline():
    from scripts.quick_add import QuickCaptureOrchestrator
    orchestrator = QuickCaptureOrchestrator()
    result = orchestrator.process_note({"content": "Integration test note"})
    assert result.success
```

## Running Tests

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Run specific test file**:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_basic_functionality.py
  ```
- **Run with coverage**:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=snr-quickcapture/scripts
  ```

## Best Practices
- **Clear Test Cases**: Write clear, descriptive test cases to ensure they are understandable and maintainable.
- **Use Fixtures**: Use fixtures for setup/teardown to reduce code duplication and improve test reliability.
- **Mock Dependencies**: Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit under test and avoid side effects.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Test error scenarios and edge cases to ensure robustness.
- **Fast and Isolated**: Keep tests fast and isolated to provide quick feedback and avoid flaky tests.
- **Regular Review**: Review test results regularly to catch issues early and maintain test quality.

## CI Integration
- **CI Tools**: Use GitHub Actions or similar for CI to automate testing and ensure consistent quality.
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests on every pull request to catch issues before merging.
- **Build Failures**: Fail builds on test failures to enforce code quality.
- **Coverage Reporting**: Report coverage and test results to track progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Design Decisions

- **Isolation of Tests**: Tests are designed to be isolated to ensure that they do not interfere with each other, providing reliable and repeatable results.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The goal of achieving >90% code coverage ensures that most of the codebase is tested, reducing the likelihood of undetected bugs.
- **Use of Mocks**: Mocks are used extensively in unit tests to isolate the unit under test and to simulate complex interactions with external systems.
- **Continuous Feedback**: The integration of tests with CI provides continuous feedback to developers, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Conclusion

The testing framework in QuickCapture is designed to ensure the reliability, correctness, and maintainability of the system. By employing a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and regression tests, the framework provides a robust foundation for validating the system's functionality and performance. The use of best practices and CI integration further enhances the quality and reliability of the testing process.
