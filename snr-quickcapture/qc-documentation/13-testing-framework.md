# Testing Framework

## Overview

QuickCapture includes a robust testing framework to ensure system reliability, correctness, and maintainability. This document describes the testing strategy, test types, and best practices for testing the system and its extensions.

## Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated test runs on every commit
- **Coverage Goals**: Aim for >90% code coverage on core modules

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and classes
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Fast execution, high isolation

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components (e.g., ingestion + embedding)
- Use real or test databases and storage
- Validate data flow and error handling

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Simulate real user workflows
- Test full pipeline from input to storage
- Validate system behavior under realistic scenarios

### 4. Performance Tests
- Benchmark processing speed, throughput, and resource usage
- Stress and load testing
- Identify bottlenecks and regressions

### 5. Regression Tests
- Ensure new changes do not break existing features
- Run on every release and major change

## Test Organization

- All tests are located in the `snr-quickcapture/tests/` directory
- Test files are named `test_*.py`
- Use `pytest` as the main test runner

## Example Test Structure
```
tests/
├── test_basic_functionality.py
├── test_failed_notes.py
├── test_observability.py
```

## Example Unit Test
```python
def test_note_validation():
    from scripts.validate_note import validate_note
    note = {"content": "Test note", "note_id": "123"}
    result = validate_note(note)
    assert result.is_valid
```

## Example Integration Test
```python
def test_full_pipeline():
    from scripts.quick_add import QuickCaptureOrchestrator
    orchestrator = QuickCaptureOrchestrator()
    result = orchestrator.process_note({"content": "Integration test note"})
    assert result.success
```

## Running Tests

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Run specific test file:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_basic_functionality.py
  ```
- Run with coverage:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=snr-quickcapture/scripts
  ```

## Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive test cases
- Use fixtures for setup/teardown
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Keep tests fast and isolated
- Review test results regularly

## CI Integration
- Use GitHub Actions or similar for CI
- Run tests on every pull request
- Fail builds on test failures
- Report coverage and test results
