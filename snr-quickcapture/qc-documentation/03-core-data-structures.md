# Core Data Structures

## Overview

QuickCapture employs a robust set of data structures to manage notes, metadata, and system state. These structures are designed to maintain consistency, ensure type safety, and facilitate efficient data processing across the system.

## Primary Data Models

### Note Structure

The `Note` class is the fundamental data structure representing a note within the system. It encapsulates all necessary information about a note, including its content, metadata, and classification details.

```python
class Note:
    note_id: str              # Unique identifier for the note
    content: str              # Main content of the note
    title: Optional[str]      # Optional title of the note
    tags: List[str]           # List of tags associated with the note
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Additional metadata as key-value pairs
    created_at: datetime      # Timestamp of note creation
    updated_at: datetime      # Timestamp of the last update
    embedding: Optional[List[float]]  # Semantic embedding vector for the note
    category: Optional[str]   # Category assigned to the note
    confidence_score: float   # Confidence score of the note's classification
    source: Optional[str]     # Source from which the note was derived
    quality_score: float      # Assessment of the note's content quality
```

**Purpose**: The `Note` class serves as the primary container for note data, supporting operations such as storage, retrieval, and processing.

**Key Attributes**:
- `note_id`: Ensures each note is uniquely identifiable.
- `content`: Holds the main textual content of the note.

**Usage**: Instances of `Note` are created and manipulated throughout the system to represent and manage individual notes.

### Metadata Structure

The `NoteMetadata` class provides extended information about a note, focusing on its origin, processing, and analysis results.

```python
class NoteMetadata:
    author: Optional[str]     # Author of the note
    source_type: str          # Type of source (e.g., file, API, manual)
    file_path: Optional[str]  # Path to the original file, if applicable
    processing_time: float    # Time taken to process the note
    validation_status: str    # Result of the note's validation
