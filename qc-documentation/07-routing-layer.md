# Routing Layer

## Overview

The routing layer is responsible for intelligently directing processed content to appropriate storage systems, classification engines, and processing pipelines based on content characteristics, system load, and business rules.

## Core Components

### 1. Content Router

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Routing Metrics

```python
class RoutingMetrics:
    """
    Collects and records routing decision metrics.
    """
    def record_routing_decision(self, content: ProcessedContent, decision: RoutingDecision):
        """
        Record metrics for a routing decision.

        Parameters:
        - content (ProcessedContent): The content that was routed.
        - decision (RoutingDecision): The decision made for routing.
        """
        # Track routing decisions
        # Monitor routing performance
        # Record decision accuracy
        # Track destination usage
    
    def record_routing_error(self, error: RoutingError):
        """
        Record metrics for a routing error.

        Parameters:
        - error (RoutingError): The error encountered during routing.
        """
        # Track error types
        # Monitor error rates
        # Record error impact
        # Track recovery times
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring

```python
class RoutingPerformanceMonitor:
    """
    Monitors the performance of the routing layer.
    """
    def monitor_routing_performance(self) -> RoutingPerformanceMetrics:
        """
        Monitor routing layer performance and return metrics.

        Returns:
        - RoutingPerformanceMetrics: The performance metrics of the routing layer.
        """
        return RoutingPerformanceMetrics(
            average_decision_time=self.calculate_average_decision_time(),
            routing_accuracy=self.calculate_routing_accuracy(),
            destination_utilization=self.calculate_destination_utilization(),
            error_rate=self.calculate_error_rate()
        )
```
