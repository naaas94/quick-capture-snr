# Extension Points

## Overview

QuickCapture is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to add new features, integrate with external systems, and customize core behaviors. This extensibility is crucial for adapting the system to evolving requirements and integrating with diverse environments. This document outlines the main extension points and best practices for extending the system, providing developers with the tools and guidelines necessary to enhance QuickCapture's functionality.

## Extension Mechanisms

### 1. Plugin Architecture

The plugin architecture allows developers to extend QuickCapture's capabilities by adding custom plugins that can process data, perform specific tasks, or integrate with external systems.

#### Plugin Interface
```python
class QuickCapturePlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Initialize the plugin with the given configuration.

        Parameters:
        - config (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration settings for the plugin.
        """
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, data: Any) -> Any:
        """Process the given data and return the result.

        Parameters:
        - data (Any): The data to be processed by the plugin.

        Returns:
        - Any: The processed data.
        """
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def shutdown(self):
        """Perform any necessary cleanup before the plugin is shut down."""
        pass
```

**Purpose**: The `QuickCapturePlugin` interface defines the contract for all plugins, ensuring consistency and compatibility with the QuickCapture system.

**Usage**: Implement this interface to create custom plugins that can be registered and used within the system.

#### Plugin Registration
```python
class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = []

    def register_plugin(self, plugin: QuickCapturePlugin):
        """Register a new plugin with the manager.

        Parameters:
        - plugin (QuickCapturePlugin): The plugin to be registered.
        """
        self.plugins.append(plugin)

    def process_with_plugins(self, data: Any) -> Any:
        """Process data using all registered plugins.

        Parameters:
        - data (Any): The data to be processed.

        Returns:
        - Any: The processed data after all plugins have been applied.
        """
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            data = plugin.process(data)
        return data
```

**Purpose**: The `PluginManager` class manages the lifecycle of plugins, including registration and data processing.

**Usage**: Use this class to register and manage plugins, ensuring they are applied to data as needed.

- **Register new storage backends**: Configure these backends in the system configuration, enabling their use within QuickCapture.

**Purpose**: To provide flexible storage options, accommodating different data storage needs and environments.

**Usage**: Develop and register custom storage engines to meet specific storage requirements.

### 5. Embedding Models

Embedding models are used to generate semantic representations of data, facilitating tasks like similarity search and classification.

- **Integrate custom or third-party models**: Add new models to the system to enhance its semantic processing capabilities.
- **Register new models**: Configure these models in the embedding configuration, making them available for use.

**Purpose**: To enhance the system's semantic processing capabilities by integrating advanced embedding models.

**Usage**: Add and configure new models to improve semantic analysis and processing.

### 6. Classification Models

Classification models categorize data based on its content, enabling automated tagging and organization.

- **Add new classification models or rules**: Implement custom models or rules to improve classification accuracy and relevance.
- **Register custom logic**: Configure these models in the `tag_intelligence` configuration, integrating them into the system.

**Purpose**: To improve data classification and organization through advanced models and rules.

**Usage**: Develop and configure new classification models to enhance data categorization.

## Extension Best Practices

- **Follow interface contracts and type hints**: Ensure compatibility and maintainability by adhering to defined interfaces and type hints.
- **Use configuration files for extension settings**: Centralize configuration in files to simplify management and deployment.
- **Document all custom extensions**: Provide clear documentation for all extensions to facilitate understanding and maintenance.

```python
class CustomTaggingPlugin(QuickCapturePlugin):
    def initialize(self, config):
        """Initialize the plugin with keyword configuration.

        Parameters:
        - config (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration settings, including keywords for tagging.
        """
        self.keywords = config.get('keywords', [])

    def process(self, data):
        """Tag data based on configured keywords.

        Parameters:
        - data (Dict[str, Any]): The data to be processed, expected to contain a 'content' field.

        Returns:
        - Dict[str, Any]: The processed data with added tags.
        """
        tags = [kw for kw in self.keywords if kw in data['content']]
        data['tags'].extend(tags)
        return data

    def shutdown(self):
        """Perform any necessary cleanup before the plugin is shut down."""
