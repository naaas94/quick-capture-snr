# Configuration Management

## Overview

QuickCapture employs a comprehensive configuration management system that centralizes all system settings, rules, and parameters. This system ensures consistency, maintainability, and flexibility across the entire application, allowing for seamless updates and modifications.

## Configuration Structure

### Configuration Directory Layout

The configuration files are organized within the `config/` directory, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`grammar_rules.yaml`**: Contains input validation and grammar rules.
- **`semantic_validation.yaml`**: Configures semantic processing parameters.
- **`storage_config.yaml`**: Defines storage system settings.
- **`tag_intelligence.yaml`**: Manages classification and tagging rules.
- **`observability.yaml`**: Sets up monitoring and logging configurations.

## Configuration Files

### 1. Grammar Rules (`grammar_rules.yaml`)

This file defines the validation rules for input processing, ensuring that all data adheres to specified standards before being processed.

```yaml
grammar_rules:
  validation_rules:
    content_length:
      min_length: 10
      max_length: 10000
      error_message: "Content must be between 10 and 10000 characters"
    
    required_fields:
      fields: ["content", "note_id"]
      error_message: "Required fields missing"
    
    content_format:
      allowed_patterns: ["^[\\w\\s\\.,!?-]+$"]
      prohibited_patterns: ["<script>", "javascript:"]
      error_message: "Invalid content format detected"
  
  content_rules:
    html_stripping:
      enabled: true
      patterns: ["<[^>]*>"]
      replacement: ""
    
    whitespace_normalization:
      enabled: true
      multiple_spaces: true
      trailing_whitespace: true
```

**Purpose**: To enforce content standards and prevent invalid or harmful data from entering the system.

**Key Rules**:
- `content_length`: Ensures notes have a reasonable length.
- `html_stripping`: Cleans HTML tags from note content.

**Usage**: Applied during the note validation phase to maintain data integrity.

### 2. Semantic Validation (`semantic_validation.yaml`)

This file configures the parameters for semantic processing and validation, enhancing the system's ability to categorize and retrieve notes accurately.

```yaml

**Usage**: Used to monitor system health and performance, triggering alerts when issues arise.

## Configuration Loading

### Loading Process

The configuration loading process involves several steps to ensure that the correct settings are applied:

1. **Environment Detection**: The system detects the current environment (development, staging, production).
2. **File Loading**: Configuration files are loaded in order of precedence.
3. **Validation**: Configuration is validated against predefined schemas.
4. **Merging**: Environment-specific overrides are applied.
5. **Initialization**: Configuration is used to initialize system components.

### Configuration Precedence

The order of precedence for configuration settings is as follows:

1. Default configuration (built-in)
2. Configuration files (config/*.yaml)
3. Environment variables (QC_*)
4. Command-line arguments
5. Runtime overrides

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Environment-specific configurations allow for tailored settings based on the deployment environment:

```yaml
# config/development.yaml
development:
  logging:
    level: "DEBUG"
  storage:
    vector_store:
      path: "./dev_storage/vector_store"
  observability:
    metrics:
      collection_interval: 30

# config/production.yaml
production:
  logging:
    level: "WARNING"
  storage:
    backup_enabled: true
    compression: true
  observability:
    alerts:
      enabled: true
```

**Purpose**: To provide flexibility and adaptability across different environments.

**Usage**: Applied during system startup to configure environment-specific settings.

## Configuration Validation

### Schema Validation

Each configuration file has a corresponding schema that defines:

- Required fields
- Data types
- Value ranges
- Nested structure validation

### Runtime Validation

Runtime validation ensures that configurations are consistent and compliant with system requirements:

- Configuration consistency checks
- Dependency validation
- Resource availability verification
- Security policy compliance

### Validation Examples

Example validation rules are implemented in Python to ensure configurations meet expected standards:

```python
# Example validation rules
validation_rules = {
    "storage_config": {
        "vector_store": {
            "type": {"required": True, "enum": ["chroma", "faiss", "pinecone"]},
            "path": {"required": True, "type": "string"},
            "embedding_dimension": {"type": "integer", "min": 128, "max": 2048}
        }
    },
    "semantic_validation": {
        "confidence_threshold": {"type": "float", "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0}
    }
}
```

**Purpose**: To ensure that all configurations are valid and ready for use.

**Usage**: Applied during configuration loading and updates to verify settings.

## Dynamic Configuration

### Runtime Updates

The system supports dynamic configuration updates, allowing for changes without downtime:

- Configuration hot-reloading capability
- Component-specific configuration updates
- A/B testing configuration support
- Feature flag management

### Configuration API

The `ConfigurationManager` class provides an API for managing configurations programmatically:

```python
# Example configuration API
class ConfigurationManager:
    def get_config(self, section: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
    def update_config(self, section: str, updates: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool
    def reload_config(self) -> bool
    def validate_config(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult
```

**Purpose**: To facilitate programmatic access and updates to configuration settings.

**Usage**: Used by system components to retrieve and update configurations as needed.

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data

Security measures are in place to protect sensitive configuration data:

- API keys and secrets stored securely
- Environment variable usage for sensitive data
- Encryption for configuration files
- Access control for configuration management

### Configuration Security

Security settings ensure that configuration management is secure and compliant:

```yaml
security:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
    algorithm: "AES-256"
    key_source: "environment"
  
  access_control:
    config_read_permission: "authenticated"
    config_write_permission: "admin"
    audit_logging: true
```

**Purpose**: To safeguard configuration data and prevent unauthorized access.

**Usage**: Applied during configuration management to enforce security policies.

## Configuration Best Practices

### Organization

Best practices for organizing configuration files include:

- Group related settings together
- Use descriptive names for configuration keys
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document all configuration options

### Maintenance

Maintenance practices ensure that configurations remain up-to-date and reliable:

- Version control for configuration files
- Configuration change tracking
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Migration scripts for configuration updates

### Monitoring

Monitoring practices help detect and address configuration issues:

- Configuration change alerts
- Configuration drift detection
- Performance impact monitoring
- Usage analytics for configuration options

**Purpose**: To ensure that configurations are well-organized, maintained, and monitored for optimal performance.

**Usage**: Implemented as part of the system's configuration management strategy.
